Wind Measurement Station – Anemometer and Direction
This project implements the reading of wind speed and wind direction using sensors connected to an Arduino/ESP32-compatible board. The data is processed and displayed in real-time via the serial monitor

Sensors Used

Anemometer (Wind Speed) – Counts pulses generated by rotations.
Wind Vane (Wind Direction) – Analog sensor that varies the voltage according to the direction.

WindDirectionSensor
Description
Analog sensor that detects wind direction based on electrical voltage. Each voltage value corresponds to a fixed angle and a cardinal direction.
Initialization
"cpp"
WindDirectionSensor(gpio_num_t pin);

Performs an analog reading and returns a struct with:

| Field | Type | Description |
| voltage | float | Voltage read on the pin (0–3.3V) |
| angle | int | Corresponding angle (0°–360°) |
| direction | std::string | Text direction (e.g., "South") |

Voltage ↔ Direction Mapping

| Voltage (V) | Angle | Direction |
| ≤ 2.90 | 0° | North |
| ≤ 3.05 | 315° | Northwest |
| ≤ 3.25 | 270° | West |
| ≤ 3.45 | 225° | Southwest |
| ≤ 3.75 | 180° | South |
| ≤ 4.00 | 135° | Southeast |
| ≤ 4.25 | 90° | East |
| ≤ 4.65 | 45° | Northeast |

AnemometerSensor

Description
A digital sensor that measures wind speed by counting pulses. Each pulse represents a partial rotation of the blades.

Initialization
AnemometerSensor(gpio_num_t pin);

- Configures the pin as input with pull-up.
- Associates an interrupt for pulse counting (falling edge - FALLING).

ISR (Interrupt Service Routine)
Pulse counting is performed asynchronously via an interrupt:
void IRAM_ATTR handleInterrupt();

Method read()
Counts pulses over 1 second and returns a struct with:

| Field | Type | Description |
| pulses | unsigned int | Number of pulses detected |
| wind_speed | float | Wind speed in km/h |

Formula used: speed = pulses \* 2.4
(2.4 km/h per pulse per second)

Example Output in Serial Monitor
Wind Direction: Northwest (315°)
Analog Voltage: 3.00 V
Wind Speed: 12.00 km/h
Pulses: 5

Reading Cycle
The main code performs:

- Direction reading via analogRead.
- Speed measurement for 1 second via interrupt.
- Data display in Serial Monitor every 2 seconds.

Requirements

- ESP32 or Arduino board with support for interrupts and analog pins.
- Arduino IDE configured for your board.
- Libraries:- Arduino.h
- driver/gpio.h (for ESP32)
